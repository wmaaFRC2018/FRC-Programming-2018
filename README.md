This version includes a working base subsystem with WIP CheesyDrive command (including the external classes required [ex: CheesyDriveHelpeer.java]) under Drive_Command that replaces the old code. Cross The Road Firmware Files (CRF) have been added and Phoenix Framework API is now functional (Be sure to add a new variable for the CRF in order to make use of the API. See: https://github.com/CrossTheRoadElec/Phoenix-Documentation/blob/master/README.md). Added an unfinished arm subsytem that makes use of the TalonSRX.
